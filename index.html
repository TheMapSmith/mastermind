        A mastermind is a group of people who come together to reach a common goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our goal:</strong><br>
        <strong>Work together to build successful geospatial careers. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can think of a mastermind group as a kind of like a professional <em>show-and-tell</em>.
        We meet regularly to discuss our success, share our failures, and get help from one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          If you want to build a succesful career in the geospatial industry, it
          helps to be surrounded by <em>inspirational people.</em>
        </strong>
      </p>

          <p>
            People who challenge you to learn and grow, who
            won't let you quit, and who will hold you accountable <strong>to yourself.</strong>
          </p>

          <br>
          <img src="5closest.png" alt="" class="blog-image img-responsive"/>

          <p>
            Stop tinkering alone and join a group to <strong>share</strong> your knowledge and
            <strong>learn</strong> from others like you in the geospatial industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will bring our collective minds together in an
            <strong>honest, open,</strong> and <strong><em>inclusive</em></strong> way to help further our goal.

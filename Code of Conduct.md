#Code of Conduct

The Spatial Community
Version 1: Released XX,XX,2015

Changelog:
First release

##Creating a Culture of Innovation
We aspire to create a culture where people work joyfully, communicate openly about things that matter, and collaborate on projects. We would like our community to reflect the diversity of the wider community of geospatial and IT professionals. We want to foster diversity of all kinds—not just the classes protected in law. Diversity fosters innovation. Diverse teams are creative teams. We need a diversity of perspective to create solutions for the real and urgent challenges we face.
This is the Spatial Professional Mastermind Code of Conduct. We expect everyone we work with to adhere to the rules and guidelines laid out herein. We expect everyone who joins our Mastermind to follow this code of conduct and all applicable laws. This applies to all of our methods of communication: Slack channel (including #general, #random, and DMs), the video calls, in-person small group meetings, and annual mini-cons.

##Be Empowering
Consider what you can do to encourage and support others. Make room for quieter voices to contribute. Offer support and enthusiasm for great ideas. Leverage the low cost of experimentation to support your colleagues' ideas, and take care to acknowledge the original source, not just the most recent or loudest contributor. When someone offers something unexpected, look for ways you can contribute and collaborate. Share your knowledge and skills. Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.

##Guidelines
The Spatial Professional Mastermind is an odd place. There is a mix of hobbyists and professionals, newbies and pros, lurkers and sharers, vendors and users. To keep the environment open and honest, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- If you are affiliated with a company, be sure to be open and honest when recommending your products.
- Use a photo of yourself for your profile image
- Include your real name
- Please limit commercial promotion of yourself or your company.

###New channel creation
We want to support the wide range of topics people might want to come here to discuss, but it’s hard to balance that support with making The Spatial Community approachable. New channels can be created by anybody, but should generally only be created when a critical mass exists around a topic. Some short term topics like @esriuc_backchannel or @foss4g may warrant a temporary channel and will be created while timely and then retired.
Over time, if a channel becomes quiet, the admins may archive the channel.

##Boundaries
Create boundaries to your own behavior and consider how you can create safe space that helps prevent unacceptable behavior by others. We do not seek to list all cases of unacceptable behavior, but provide examples to help guide our community in thinking through how to respond when we experience these types of behavior, whether directed at ourselves or others.
If you are unsure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably isn’t. Each person you interact with can define where that line is for them. Impact matters more than intent. Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your responsibility. Problems happen when we assume that our way of thinking or behaving is the norm or ok with everyone. This is particularly problematic when we are in a position of power or privilege.

Here are a few examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Negative or offensive remarks based on the protected classes as listed in the GSA Anti-harassment Policy of race, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, or clothing. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.
- Touching people without their affirmative consent.
- Sustained and negative disruption of meetings or talks.
- Patronizing language or behavior.
- Aggressive and micro-aggressive behavior, such as unconstructive criticism, providing corrections that do not improve the conversation (sometimes referred to as "well actually"s), repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else, feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic, or subtle prejudice (for example, comments like “That’s so easy my grandmother could do it.”).
- Referring to people in a way that misidentifies their gender and/or rejects the validity of their gender identity; for instance by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering).
- Retaliating against anyone who files a formal complaint that someone has violated these codes or laws.

##Reporting

Like the technical community as a whole, the The Spatial Community community is made up of spatial thinkers and doers from all over the world.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to all members of the The Spatial Community Slack channel.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all channels managed by the The Spatial Community. This includes public channels, private channels, direct messages and private groups.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing.

Be friendly and patient.
Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the <INSERT NAME HERE> community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the <INSERT NAME HERE> community.
Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
Violent threats or language directed against another person.
Discriminatory jokes and language.
Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
Unwelcome sexual attention.
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and The Spatial Community is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of The Spatial Community comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
